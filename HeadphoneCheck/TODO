TODO:
-----
  - check browser compatibility
  - document public API
  - documentation?

DONE:
-----
x - document events
x  - move to public github
x  - rename to HeadphoneCheck
x  - update package.json github
x  - readme
x  - demos
x  - add authors to every file
x  - defaults
x  - Put example sounds on AWS S3
x  - grunt project and minify
x  - when browser is thin (say half of screen size on laptop), the response text
    flows onto multiple lines for some but not all responses. it should be the
    same for all.
x - shouldn't allow playing the next sound before responding to the current one
x - How to check correctness?: naively
x - API
x - add events
x - document
x - errors on dumb
x - calibration
x - ajax fetch to async
x - branch for progress caching, then remove progress caching and merge to master
x - calibration sound should be configurable
x - Sample with replacement
x - handle ajax error
x - random with replacement
x - fire events on all major state changes (in parenthesis means not required)
x    + overall begin/end
x    + stim json success/fail/done
x    + calibration begin/end
x    + headphone check begin/end
x - fine grained detail of response per trial: implemented per trial score
x - do we need a more fine grained warning/feedback system?: kind of implemented this for sequential trials
  - check playback counters if `requirePlayback` is false
x - json schema -> what if IDs aren't unique?: shouldn't matter, each trials has a unique index prefix
x - render finished page?: this is the user's responsibility

DEFERRED:
---------
DEFER  - figure out how to handle css styles properly
DEFER  - support for multiple audio sources
DEFER  - fix audio source type
DEFER    + Fire event on (renderHTMLPage with pageNum data)
DEFER    + Fire event on (per trial rendering seems like overkill)
DEFER  - local storage progress caching
DEFER    + we need to track per trial responses and playback status (probably easier than inferring from disabled button states)
DEFER - refactor all callback and event binding to single function? it's pretty messy as it is
